This is Project 2 for the Treehouse Tech Degree Program for Charlie Sattgast.

This was a really good project for solidifying concepts and skills. I started out building the whole project with floats and then eventually decided to rebuild it with Flexbox after talking with both Andrew and Merritt from Treehouse. I gained a good understanding about floats and why Flexbox is a lot easier to work with.
